# Java API Features Map ![](https://travis-ci.org/arno-di-loreto/openapi-map.svg?branch=master)

The Java API Language Features Map (**Illustrating Java API Features Java 8 and onwards till latest Java version  - Java 14**)

It is an Interactive Tree presentation of key features of the Java Language - 8 till 14 with detailed examples.

Interactive Tree Map developed by [Rahul Saini](https://sainirahul.wordpress.com).

## How to use it?

- Zoom in: Mouse scroll up
- Zoom out: Mouse scroll down
- Move: Mouse drag
- Clicking on a node expand or collapse it
- Moving mouse over a node shows its documentation

## How does it work?

### Configuration

The `data/spec-versions.json` file, loaded when `index.html` is load by browser, lists OpenAPI versions which are visible in top right navigation bar:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Version 3.0",
    "id": "3.0",
    "url": "3.0.1.json",
    "root": "OpenAPI Object",
    "specificationurl": "https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md"
  },
  {
    "name": "Version 2.0",
    "id": "2.0",
    "url": "2.0.json",
    "root": "Swagger Object",
    "specificationurl": "https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md"
  }
]
```

| Property         | Description 
|------------------|-----------------
| name             | The name that will appear in tabs
| id               | The json file id to use for direct access `http://openapi-map.apihandyman.io?version=<id>`. Example: http://openapi-map.apihandyman.io?version=3.0 
| url              | The json file's url containing the data
| root             | The root object of this version
| specificationurl | The md file URL for this specification

The data of each version comes from a `<version>.json` file defined in `url`. This file has been generated on build based on data yaml files from folder `data/<version>`.
The data contains informations coming from the specification available at `specificationUrl`.

### Data files
The *data* folder contains sets of YAML files (one per version of the OpenAPI Specification) describing each object provided by the OpenAPI Specification.

```
data
├── 2.0
│   ├── Contact_Object.yaml
│   ├── Definitions_Object.yaml
    ...
│   ├── Swagger_Object.yaml
│   └── Tag_Object.yaml
└── 3.0.1
    ├── Callback_Object.yaml
    ├── Components_Object.yaml
    ...
    ├── OpenAPI_Object.yaml
    ...
    └── XML_Object.yaml
```

The content of these files is based on the OpenAPI Specification itself, some precisions have been added when needed.

```yaml
Some Object:
  description: |
    This is `Some Object`' description,
  allowExtension: true
  changelog:
    isNew: true
    details: Contains former root `responses`, `parameters` (split into `parameters` and `requestBodies`) and `definitions` (as `schemas`).
  fields:
    - 
      name: schemas
      type: "{Schema Object}"
      changelog:
        isInfo: true
        details: Replace root `definitions`
      description: An object to hold reusable [Schema Objects](#schemaObject).
```

### Data file structure

| Property         | Required | Description 
|------------------|----------|--------------
| name             |    no    | Optional name used for node's label, if not provided the label is the Object type.
| description      |    yes   | Object's description.
| allowExtension   |    no    | Tells this object is extensible with `x-` properties, false by default. If true a `x-` node it automatically added to the object's properties.
| changelog        |    no    | Describes the modifications from previous version
| changelog.isNew  |    no    | True is this is a new object
| changelog.isModified |no    | True is this is a modfied object
| changelog.description |no   | Changelog description, markdown can be used
| changelog.deletedProperties[]|no| List of deleted properties
| changelog.deletedProperties[].name |yes| Deleted property's name
| changelog.deletedProperties[].replacedBy |no| New property replacing it
| changelog.deletedProperties[].see |yes| Object's holding the new property
| fields[]        |   yes     | Object's properties list
| fields[].name   |   yes     | Property's name
| fields[].type   |   yes     | Property's type. Use `"[Some Object]"` or `"[string]"` for arrays. Use `"{Some Object}"`, `"{string}"` or `"{Custom Key, Some Object}"` for maps (a property representing the map key is automatically added to object's properties)
| fields[].required|   no     | Property is required if true, false by default
| fields[].description|   no  | Property's description.
| fields[].changelog | no     | Describes the modifications from previous version
| fields[].changelog.isNew  |    no    | True is this is a new object
| fields[].changelog.isModified |no    | True is this is a modfied object
| fields[].changelog.description |no   | Changelog description.

### About descriptions

All `description` properties can contain [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
If a description contains some links, they are modified that way:

- A `target=_blank` is added to all links
- Anchor links coming from the specification, like this `[Schema Objects](#schemaObject)` are modified to target the `specificationurl` provided in version's configuration
- Links to `../examples` are update to target the OpenAPI github repository according to the `specificationurl` provided in version's configuration

## Build and modify

### Prerequisites

You need to install gulp and mocha and download dependencies in order to build the project:

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install -g mocha
npm install
```

### Commands

| Command         | Decription
|-----------------|-----------
| `npm run server`| Launch a local instance with automatic live reload (test then build)
| `npm run build` | Tests then builds the OpenAPI Map in `dist`

### Code notes

| File | Description
|------|-------------
| `gulpfiles.js/build-data-files task` | Concatenates the data files and converts the result in json in a `dist/<version>.json` file for each data set.
| `web/static/js/buildTree.js` | Contains all functions used to build data tree from a `dist/<version>.json` file.
| `web/static/js/drawTree.js` | Contains all function to draw the D3JS tree in left panel using the data tree generated by `buildTree.js` functions.
| `web/static/templates.tooltip.hbs` | Handlebar template which is used to show documentation of each node. This template is compiled in the `dist/js/template.js` file by build task.
| `web/static/js/main.js` | Triggers data loading and tree generation when `web/static/index.html` is loaded by browser.

### Tools used

This project uses:

- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to automate development tasks
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to test the JS code
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework to lessen the pain of doing HTML and CSS
- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates for the left panel showing the documentation
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons
- [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to convert markdown descriptions in HTML
- [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) a human friendly data serialization
  standard for all programming languages to store the OpenAPI Map data
- [d3js](http://d3js.org/) to draw the map
  - The d3 tree is based on [D3.js Drag and Drop, Zoomable, Panning, Collapsible Tree with auto-sizing.](http://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7880033) by [Rob Schmuecker](https://github.com/robschmuecker).
  - The tooltip has been inspired by [Adding tooltips to a d3.js graph](http://www.d3noob.org/2013/01/adding-tooltips-to-d3js-graph.html) by [3D Noob](http://www.d3noob.org/).

## CI and Hosting

This project is build by [Travis CI](travis-ci.org) and deployed on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the following files:

- .travis.yml: Travis CI Configuration file
- scripts/deploy.sh: Deploy script (which basically commits the result of the build on the gh-pages branch of this repository)

**WARNING**: Do not forget to update the `web/CNAME` file when changing Github Page domain using the Github admin.
